**Nurse Next AI** is a simple, empathetic chat interface that provides **general, educational health
information**. It does **not** diagnose, prescribe medication, or determine drug doses.  
It‚Äôs built with **Streamlit** (UI) and **OpenAI** models (responses), with basic **guardrails** for safety.

    """
1. Type a question in the chat box on the home page.  
2. You‚Äôll get a short, structured reply with general information and suggested next steps.  
3. If your message contains urgent red-flag symptoms, you‚Äôll see a prompt to **seek emergency care**.  
4. For personal medical advice, always consult a licensed professional.

- **Not a doctor:** Replies are educational only; no prescriptions, no dosing, and no medical decisions.
- **Guardrails:** Emergency and disallowed topics trigger a safe response (e.g., ‚Äúcall emergency services‚Äù or ‚Äúcan‚Äôt help with that‚Äù).
- **Uncertainty:** If unsure, the assistant should say so and suggest safe next steps.

- Ask **one thing at a time** with relevant background (age range, general context).  
- If you want more detail, say ‚Äúprovide more detail‚Äù or ask for **pros/cons** or **next steps**.
- You can switch languages; short, clear wording helps.

- **Blank or odd UI**: Refresh the page. If the floating chat overlaps controls, it auto-adjusts its position.
