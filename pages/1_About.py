- üõë Protects you by **blocking medical prescriptions or dosages** ‚Äî this app is for learning, not treatment.  
- üîÑ **Smart reliability**: if one AI service is too busy, it can automatically switch to another in the background.  
- üîí **Private by design**: your questions and answers only stay in your session ‚Äî nothing is saved or shared.

To keep the chat smooth and responsive, Nurse Next AI connects to different AI providers.  
It will always try the most reliable option first, and switch if needed:

1. **Groq (main choice)**  
   - Fast, free-tier friendly.  
   - Default model: `llama3-70b-8192` (unless you change it).  

2. **OpenAI (backup option)**  
   - Uses popular models like `gpt-4o-mini`.  

3. **OpenRouter (extra backup)**  
   - Can route to other models such as Google‚Äôs Gemini.  

> Most of the time, you don‚Äôt need to worry about this ‚Äî the app picks the best available option for you.
